# Cards to Components

This repository acts as a step-by-step in converting cards built in static HTML & [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io) into React components.

This project is built with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), with a new branch for each part.

To get started, `cd reactify-card` and `npm start`.
