# Cards to Components

This repository acts as a step-by-step in converting cards built in static HTML/CSS & [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io) into reusable and composable React components.

This project is built with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), with a new branch for each part.

To get started, clone the repo and follow along with the [ordered branches](https://github.com/tayiorbeii/reactify-cards/branches)!
